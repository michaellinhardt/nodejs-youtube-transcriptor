- Focus on leveraging AI infrastructure company is already rolling out

## Three Major Changes in AI During 2025

### 1. AI Moved from Chat Interface to Infrastructure Layer

**Previous State (2023-2024):**
- AI experienced primarily as chat box
- Writing assistant functionality
- Code completion tools
- Chat interface as primary interaction model

**Current State (2025):**
- Chat interface now most superficial layer
- AI operates as infrastructure underneath applications
- Fundamental architectural transformation

### 2. Architecture Standardization

**Industry Definition of AI Agents:**
- Agent operates as a loop with defined components:
  - Goal setting
  - Context gathering
  - Reasoning
  - Action execution
  - Observation

**Multi-Agent System Patterns:**
- Planner agents
- Retriever agents
- Executor agents
- Coordinated multi-agent architectures

**Agent Maturity Model:**
- Range: Simple tool calling → Self-improving systems
- Most organizations not yet at self-improving level
- Clear progression pathway established

**Design Principles Emerging:**
- Budgetary authority for agents
- Agent boundaries and constraints
- Security identity management
- Standards still evolving but becoming defined

**Impact:**
- Prior to 2025: Agents mostly theoretical or point solutions
- Post-2025: Standardized architecture enables comprehensive agent deployments

**Reference:** Google's "Introduction to AI Agents" paper exemplifies standardization

### 3. Security Transition from Hypothetical to Operational

**2025 Shadow IT Era (Ending):**
- Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI) to work
- Personal ChatGPT usage
- Limited security oversight
- Hope security teams won't notice

**2026 Security Reality:**
- CISOs have implemented approved tool lists
- Tools now "inside the fences"
- Approved tools include: Claude Code, ChatGPT, Lovable
- Unauthorized tools increasingly caught and blocked

**Security Focus Shift:**
- Moving into agent-specific security
- Meaningful AI initiatives require IT partnership
- Individual team deployments without security review becoming prohibited
- Security collaboration now essential skill

### 4. Enterprise Learning: Where AI Agents Actually Work

**Proven Success Pattern (Consistent Across Hundreds of Deployments):**

AI agents deliver reliable ROI when work tasks are:
- **Bounded in scope:** Clearly defined boundaries
- **Objectively verifiable:** Results can be checked
- **Repetitive:** Same process executed multiple times
- **Clear inputs/outputs:** Defined data flows

**Successful Agent Application Areas:**
- Back office operations
- Triage operations
- Claims processing
- Lead qualification
- Document verification/checks
- Basic compliance tasks
- Customer support flows

**Unsuccessful Agent Applications:**
- Strategic product invention
- High-level strategy development
- Ambiguous creative work

**Key Insight:** Agents excel at executing consistent processes 10,000+ times without fatigue, not at strategic invention

## Three Essential Mental Models for 2026

### Mental Model 1: AI as Collaborator on Structured Work (Not Magic Brain)

**What LLMs Are Good At:**
- Pattern recognition and matching
- Text and code transformation
- Mapping messy inputs to structured outputs
- Following explicit instructions
- Executing same task thousands of times without boredom
- Consistency in repetitive work

**What LLMs Are Bad At:**
- High-stakes decisions with ambiguous trade-offs
- Understanding organizational politics
- Implicit organizational context (unless explicitly provided)
- Respecting undefined boundaries
- Nuanced judgment in novel situations

**Right Question Framework:**
- **Wrong:** "Can AI do my job?"
- **Right:** "Which parts of my job are repetitive, checkable, describable, or verifiable?"
- **Right:** "How do I turn those parts into workflows AI can run or assist with?"
- **Right:** "How do I take charge of how AI shapes my job?"

**Critical Constraint:** If you cannot describe the work clearly, AI cannot execute it

### Mental Model 2: Agents + Orchestration as New Middleware

**Middleware Evolution:**
- Traditional: Backend ↔ Middleware ↔ Frontend
- Middleware role: Translation layer between system components
- New reality: Middleware layer became intelligent through AI agents

**Agent Definition (Technical):**
- Loop around a model
- Has tools
- Maintains state
- Contains decision logic

**Critical Orchestration Questions:**

*Tool Management:*
- What tools is the agent allowed to use?
- Under what identity does it operate?
- What budget constraints exist?

*Governance:*
- Where are logs stored?
- What metrics are tracked?
- What does agent do when uncertain?

*Communication Protocols:*
- How do models talk to tools and data? (e.g., Model Context Protocol)
- What are agent-to-agent protocols?
- How do agent teams coordinate?

*Security Infrastructure:*
- What are control planes and gateways?
- Where are policy enforcement choke points?
- How is behavior observed?
- How are roles and permissions managed?

**Required Skill (Non-Technical Professionals):**
- High-level conversational fluency in agent orchestration concepts
- Ability to discuss AI workflows in organizational terms
- Translation capability between business needs and technical teams
- Not required to implement, but must understand vocabulary

### Mental Model 3: Governance as Operating System (Not Bolt-On)

**Maturity Shift:**
- AI adoption becoming enterprise-grade
- Governance requirements no longer optional

**Essential Governance Components:**
- Security
- Privacy
- Auditability
- Compliance frameworks
- Risk management

**Governance Questions Every Professional Must Answer:**

*Autonomy Levels:*
- Where can AI act autonomously in your domain?
- Where should AI only draft (human approval required)?
- Where must human approver be in loop?

*Safety Protocols:*
- How do you safely shut down agent processes?
- What are escalation procedures?

**Responsibility Shift:**
- No longer solely CISO's problem
- Every domain owner must address governance
- AI agents require local domain information and context
- Successful rollout depends on domain-specific governance frameworks

## Where AI Will Reshape Jobs: Workflow Decomposition

### Job as Stack of Workflows (Not Monolithic Role)

**Marketing Example:**
- Not "doing marketing"
- Instead: Run campaigns, create briefs, analyze performance, manage stakeholders
- Each is discrete workflow

**Product Management Example:**
- Not "do product management"
- Instead: Collect requirements, prioritize, write specs, coordinate launches
- Each is discrete workflow

**Finance Example:**
- Not "do finance"
- Instead: Reconcile accounts, forecast, analyze variances, produce reports
- Each is discrete workflow

### Workflow Decomposition Framework

Every workflow has:
1. **Triggers:** What starts the work?
2. **Inputs:** What data/information is examined?
3. **Transformations:** What processing occurs?
4. **Decisions:** What choices are made?
5. **Outputs:** What is produced?
6. **Checks:** How is correctness verified?

**AI Integration Point:** AI slots into this structured framework, not monolithic "job"

### Categories of Work Being Automated/Assisted

**Consistent Pattern Across Industries:**
- Triage tasks (sorting, categorizing)
- Routing tasks (directing to appropriate handler)
- Summarization tasks
- Synthesis tasks (combining information)
- Policy and rule application tasks
- Repetitive document workflows (form data extraction)
- Glue work across tools (Excel → Word transfers, system-to-system data movement)

**Reality Check:** Non-trivial percentage of most jobs falls into these categories

### Work Staying Human Long-Term

**Human-Dominated Domains:**
- Negotiation
- Trust building
- Organizational politics navigation
- Problem selection (deciding which problems to solve)
- Strategy setting
- Accountability when failures occur
- High-stakes judgment calls
- Relationship management

### Value Shift for Professionals

**Old Value Sources (Decreasing):**
- Executing repetitive tasks
- Manual data movement
- Routine document processing

**New Value Sources (Increasing):**
- Defining workflows
- Supervising AI-assisted processes
- Handling exceptions
- Choosing what to build
- Touching work that requires human judgment
- Strategic thinking
- Relationship and trust work

**Author's Position:** AI drains repetitive and checkable work from roles; professionals should control how this happens or others will decide for them

## Practical Implementation Path for 2026

### Step 1: Map Your Work as Systems Designer

**Workflow Documentation Exercise:**
1. List all workflows in your role
2. For each workflow, document:
   - Triggers
   - Inputs
   - Transformations
   - Decisions
   - Outputs
   - Verification checks

**Purpose:** Create structured view of your work that AI can integrate with

### Step 2: Prototype with Available Tools

**Experimentation Approach:**
- Use approved enterprise tools: ChatGPT Enterprise, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini
- Express documented workflows to these tools
- Build prototypes (even if rough/incomplete)
- Goal: Living feel for AI-agent collaboration

**What Not to Do:**
- Do not spin up rogue infrastructure
- Do not bypass security protocols
- Do not use unapproved tools

**What to Do:**
- Create demonstrable prototypes within approved tools
