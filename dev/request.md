# Request

For the following files:

@docs/requirements_functional.md
@docs/requirements_technical.md
@docs/project_overview.md
@dev/tasks.md

Initiate a sub-agent using the appropriate agent ( example for requirements_functional.md, use agt-doc-functional ) and task the agent to remove all mention about test ( unit or integration ) in the document. The agent will also specifically mention in the files ( except for tasks.md ) that the project will not include tests.

The project will not include test because it is too small, I want to be sure it is reflected in every documentation files.

The task is completed when none of this file mention about testing.
